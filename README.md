# Image-Caption-AI

Image Caption AI is a deep learning-based application that generates descriptive captions for images. Using advanced computer vision and natural language processing models, it analyzes an image and produces relevant, human-like captions.

Features üöÄ
üñºÔ∏è Automatic Image Captioning ‚Äì Generate meaningful captions for uploaded images.

ü§ñ Deep Learning-Based Model ‚Äì Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet) for image feature extraction and an LSTM-based language model for text generation.

‚ö° Fast and Efficient ‚Äì Processes images in real time to provide instant captions.

üåê Web Interface (Optional) ‚Äì Can be integrated into a web-based application for easy accessibility.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Flask / FastAPI (for API deployment)

Prerequisites & Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. You can download it from:
üîó https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
3. Install Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Ensure that your requirements.txt includes the necessary dependencies.)

4. Install Required Libraries Manually (If Needed)
If you don‚Äôt have a requirements.txt, manually install the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy tensorflow torch torchvision opencv-python pillow nltk flask fastapi uvicorn matplotlib
5. Download Pre-Trained Model (If Needed)
If your model uses ResNet, InceptionV3, or any other CNN model, ensure it is downloaded.

If using NLTK, download required data:

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
6. Ensure GPU Support (For Faster Processing - Optional)
If using CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs), install:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  # Adjust CUDA version as needed
To verify GPU support:

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True if GPU is available
7. Running the Application
If using Flask:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
If using FastAPI:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
